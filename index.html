                    For the past two years, I have worked as a UI/UX designer. I've worked with several local and foreign customers, and throughout that time I've had a lot of firsthand knowledge with product design from conception to publication. I worked two jobs full-time during this period, and I'm still a knowledgeable professional in my sector.

                    I'm attempting to learn web programming from the ground up. After that, I began learning HTML and CSS. I'm trying to create simple, small-scale pages now to explain these concepts.I hope to become the finest web developer one day.
